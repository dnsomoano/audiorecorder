WARNING:NgdBuild:1212 - User specified non-default attribute value (26.666000)
   was detected for the CLKIN_PERIOD attribute on DCM
   "clock_generator/dcm_sp_inst".  This does not match the PERIOD constraint
   value (37500 KHz.).  The uncertainty calculation will use the non-default
   attribute value.  This could result in incorrect uncertainty calculated for
   DCM output clocks.
WARNING:NgdBuild:1440 - User specified non-default attribute value (9.999) was
   detected for the CLKIN1_PERIOD attribute on PLL
   "RAMRapper/u_memory_interface/memc3_infrastructure_inst/u_pll_adv".  This
   does not match the PERIOD constraint value (100000 KHz.).  The uncertainty
   calculation will use the PERIOD constraint value.  This could result in
   incorrect uncertainty calculated for PLL output clocks.
